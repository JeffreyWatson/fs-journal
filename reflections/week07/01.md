## Questions

1. What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work?

Pair programming is when two programmers work alongside eachother with one screen, and the person who is actively on the computer is called the driver and the other partner is the navigator which is the individual that helps with focus on the overall direction of the project. 

2. What are some benefits of Pair Programming?

I think the most obvious, if the paired programs are right, can be the quality of the code being written due to the fact that you have 2 sets of eyes on the code and not just one. One will write the code and the other can see any underlying issues or maybe way to potentially make the code that was written more efficient. A more solid understanding of the code that was written can also be a huge benefit. A way to better discuss what may be going on with the code being written coming from two individuals and not just one could prove as beneficial. 

3. What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming?

It can be a waste of time if no active communication is involved between the two programmers working together. Poor pairing of programmers can also lead to, what is known as, double costs.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Pair programming can go smoothly at times but if the communication does not persist it will slowly fade and you will begin to run into issues that slow down the process extremely. Work with you team and voice those problems when they arise.
