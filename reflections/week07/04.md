# Sprint Retrospective

## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

We tried to implement trading spots often when coding to keep things fresh in both of our minds and we also did well with communicating consistently to better help us achieve whatever it was during the project that we were trying to accomplish. 

2. What went well this week?

Gaining more experience with Vue and a better understanding of how things can work and the dynamic nature of this framework. It can do things that you wouldnt even think of when you first decide to learn how to code. It was fun and challenging and that is always appreciated from me. 

3. What would you do differently?

Take time during the coding process to really discuss where we want this application to go, or how to make it look and operate. Communication was solid but roadmapping could have been done a lot better as we had to stop and really take a break when we wanted to adjust things throughout the assignment.

**[Repo](Checkpoint)**

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Im struggling with being able to stay focused and it is extremely difficult to perform what is asked of me right now. Not from a lack of knowledge but from a lack of focus. I apologize for lack of effort on this checkpoint.
