## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

1.A function declaration which defines a named function. Use function keyword then name the function. In this way the function is hoisted allowing for use before the writing of the function. 2.Function expressions defines a name or anon function. Function expressions are no hoisted so they cant be used prior to the function being defined. 3. An arrow function expression which is shorter syntax for the function expression without creating <b>this</b> value.

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

Parameters define a function or are the names created in the function definition. Arguments are the values that the function receives from each parameter when said function is invoked.

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

When a function accepts another function as a parameter, or returns a function. Just today we used a higher order function to access my array of packages, and specify a category such as heavy, to then verify if that category was true or false.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Naming a lot of the content within a function can be tricky until "I" know the order of operations and how a function is designed to work. This was an issue for me prior to doing this journal. Understanding a function, parameters, and arguments can clarify this issue of mine with further study and practice. Keep on keeping on. Motivational quote for myself.
