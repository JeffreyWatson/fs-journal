## Questions

1. What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?

Get- The get syntax binds an object property to a function that will be called when that property is looked up.
Set- The Set object lets you store unique values of any type, whether primitive values or object references. These were both copy and pasted, not gonna lie but thats the best definitions that I understand regarding them and I couldnt put them into words myself.

2. What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to ensure the value does not become `undefined`?

Ensure that you are including the two parameters of "object" the object itself and "properties" the properties being accessed when using this Get method.

3. What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?

It allows us to customize how we want our programs to run. Additionally it allows us to make sure the are certain aspects that cannot be accessed by users when developing our projects. I have not yet been able to implement this method but I can already see the ways that the proxy object can have several use cases.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Dont get in your own way and just connect the dots so to speak. Maybe even connect the wires. Its a rather complex system but one that allows for a lot more flexibility in creating your code and developing a project.
