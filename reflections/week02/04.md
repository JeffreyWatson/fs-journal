## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

I have figured this out the hard way. Im very much a go getter and I figured that this field of work would be no different. Oh how I was so very wrong!!! The benefits of planning is just that, that you have a plan! I consistently jump into a project with a thought process of coding instantly and putting things together as I go. This can be done but id imagine only with the elite of the elite developers out there. Game planning can allow for a idea built upon a thought out foundation that can be more logical and "slow" unlike the get to coding and get mind scrambled within 1 hour due to my lack of experience and thinking in general. This line of work takes a thoughtful person to achieve quality products.

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?

This is something that I have done nearly all my life. GOOGLE IT! Research research research. I know im new to this game and extremely under qualified to be coding in the first place. However with the course and internet at my disposal I believe that I can become the developer I now think I am capable of. Aside from research, I need to try and fail and try and fail so that I can sometime succeed. That should be common sense, however it is not. But its the truth and in coding I can see how trying over and over again will be a benefit in the end. Ask for help when its needed as well. I get this rush of heat all throughout my body when I get stuck and have to ask for help. I like to think that I am way smarted than that and it absolutely kills my confidence but identifying that problem is step one and step two is getting over myself and asking the professionals around me who were at one point in my shoes. 

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

Be a thinker not a doer. Kind of opposite of what ive tried to do my whole life. But essential in this line of work. To slow down and not over complicate things that can be easily solved with a bit of patience and logical thinking. And logical thinking as in a computer, not a human. Not gonna lie thats been a learning curve. Dont assume that all is well and fine because the code worked the first time. Think ahead at times and prepare for the next steps of the process. Another big one that I particularly like is about obsessing over best practices. I strongly believe that there is so much that goes into this line of work that if you think you are a pro and know it all then you are completely wrong. There is absolutely no way at all to understand ALL of coding. So dont be to confident and research and learn and get better instead of just doing something right once and being ok with it.
