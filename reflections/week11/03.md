## Questions

1. What is SQL injection?

Type of an attack that can give an adversary complete control over your web app database by inserting arbitrary SQL code into a database query. 

2. What are 3 methods SQL injection can be done by?

The first and most simple way is through user input. Second, an attacker can modify cookies to poison a web apps database query. They can modify cookies to inject SQL into the back end database. Third, Several variables such as HTTP headers can also be used as a SQL injection attack vector. Forged headers containing arbitrary SQL can inject that code into the database if the web app fails to sanitize those inputs as well. 

3. How can we detect and sanitize SQL injection attacks?

A web app firewall can detect and block basic SQL injection attacks. Intrusion detections systems both network and host based can be tuned to detect SQL injection attacks. Network based IDSed can monitor all connections to your database server, and flag suspicious activity.

You can easily get lost when trying to correctly make a many to many relationship. Be careful and code small test small. I got completely turned around when working on this project at home and it is now a disaster.
