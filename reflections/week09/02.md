## Questions

1. What is a Github action and how do they work?

They are event driven so you can run a series of commands after a specified event has occurred. Even after additional research I am struggling to find the best way to explain what a github action is. 

2. What benefits do Github actions provide?

They allow you to automate your workflow from idea to production. It is also a great way to catch errors in the early stages of production in the central place of the github repo. From a business standpoint it sounds like running tests and quality checks in an automated way will save you a lot of time and money. 

3. What types of trigger actions can a workflow use? What do they do?

To the best of my knowledge, a push, pull request, or a fork that refers to changes in the repo are triggering actions. I really hope we have time to go over this because I am really having a hard time answering this days journal questions.
