## Questions

1. What is a User Experience? What should be considered when developing a User Experience?

User experience is what the user of an app will encounter when typing in the URL and seeing the first thing that pops on there device, logging in and logging out, researching a product and buying something. You should consider focusing on what the user of this application might want and how they might want to interact with the application being used. Think with emotions to achieve this. 

2. What are some benefits of taking into account the User Experience?

You will be better able to create a product that users will like to interact with and that can lead to an abundance of positive things such as good reviews when it comes to interaction of this application. You will also be able to create something that will not take as much maintenance in the long term if users have less issues with the way an application works. 

3. Why is the User Experience important?

It is of the upmost importance because they are the ones who will be using the app that you have helped prepare. Really nobody's opinion of how anything works matters more than the user. Even the best programmer alive can have something to say about the way amazon might operate but at the end of the day if the user is happy with the product they are receiving why would anybody's opinion really matter outside of refactoring and efficiency purposes.
