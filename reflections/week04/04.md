> **ðŸ“– [The Fetch API](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/04-Fetch)**

## Questions

1. What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?

Representational state transfer. It refers to transferring representations. You use a rep of a resource to transfer resource state which lives on the server into application state of the client. Thats the best I have right now. 

2. What does Stateless mean?

it means the server does not remember anything about the user who uses the API. It doesnt remember if the user of the API already sent a GET request for the same source in the past, it doesnt remember which resources the user of the API requested before. 

3. What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?

Resource identifier resource.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Dont forget to put you img links in an img tag because thats just dumb to forget. Also you will need to better understand many apis before you can really plan how you wanted to tackle any particular api. They all vary in orientation which can make it super difficult for accessing information if you have only done it say... 3 times in a week. Its gonna be fun to better grasp this concept.
