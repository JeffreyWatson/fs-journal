## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

Unit testing, component testing, and end to end testing. Unit testing provides the ability to utilize a single component to test in isolation from the rest of the code. Component testing, In this type of testing, objects can be tested independently as a component without integrating with other components e.g. modules, classes, objects, and programs. End to end testing is a methodology used for ensuring that applications behave as expected and that the flow of data is maintained for all kinds of user tasks and processes. 

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

I would have to lean towards unit testing, which is something that I have never heard of until this reading. Simply because you can test code as you go and when you complete a particular "unit" you can test it immediately to ensure that everything is working as expected and then move on to the next portion of your code. 

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

Well from the little that i know, I would say components testing. It seems as if component testing is the in between of both of the other testing styles and could probably be the least effective of the two when regarding time and cost and other aspects of work life.
