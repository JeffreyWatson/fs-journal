## Questions

1. What is the purpose of `Async`/`Await`?

The purpose is to enable asynchronous promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style, avoiding the need to explicitly configure promise chains. So in my way of explaining async will make a function return a promise and await will make that function wait until that promise is resolved or returned. 

2. What must you do in order to  `await` a promise inside of a function?

Well first of all you need to make sure that the function is async. Secondly you need to use the await before the promise is set and the you let the magic behind the scenes play out. See... simple. 

3. What are some of the primary benefits of `Async`/`Await`?

You write less and cleaner code. It will be easier to maintain than using alternate methods. With all of the above it in turn makes promises easier to read and use which for a beginner like me will make things a lot easier to comprehend and learn along the way which can be extremely hard at times with some of the code you will find from any random google search.
