## Questions

1. What is Scope ?

Where variables are available for use. Variables can be globally scoped and function scoped where globally means the variable is available for use throughout the whole window, and function scoped means that a variable is available for use only within the function that it was created in. 

2. What is Hoisting ?

Variables and functions are moved to the top of their scope prior to code execution. Let and Const are hoisted to the top but are not initialized. Var on the other hand is hoisted to the top and initialized with a value of undefined.

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

Use CONST when you want to initialize a constant whose value does not change meaning you will need to initialize it with a value. Use Var variables when you want to scope both globally and locally with an ability to update or redefine the variable. Use Let (the most common) because it is block scoped, meaning accidentally modifying your variable is less of a chance than using var. Block scope helps with identifying bugs and cleanliness of code.

code small test small!!!!! I got ahead of myself a time or two and it completely threw me off to the point where I achieved so little in the afternoon that was given to me. An additional take away would be to pay attention to detail with your code. I found myself misplacing curly braces or quotations which are unbelievably hard to find.
