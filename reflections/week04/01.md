> **ðŸ“– [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?

Some tell signs of callback hell are heavily nested pyramid shaped pieces of code that are full of functions, logs, if, else, if, else, if, else statements throughout a block of code. While the intentions might be good it causes a jumbled mess to read and understand as a outsider looking in. It is typically caused by poor coding practices such as not keeping you code shallow, not breaking code into modules, and avoiding your callback errors.

2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?

Async means that things can happen independently of the main program flow. Effectively allowing your system to only run code that is needed and not running unnecessary code. Callbacks are involved when you for instance you use an event handler which can be called when the event is triggered. These callbacks can be used for async purposes. So callbacks arent necessarily async but can be utilized with async. 

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`

Dealing with all of you errors. Utilizing code linters which can be configured to help remember to handle callback errors. Modularize, meaning write small modules of code that each do one thing and assemble them into other modules that do a bigger thing. Keeping your code shallow. And getting better with naming conventions.
