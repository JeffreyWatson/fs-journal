## Questions

1. What function does a developer Portfolio provide?

It allows a job seeker to be able to market themselves in a way that will prove to be beneficial in there job hunt. It can be a good tool to show work that you have done in previous jobs and/or schooling. 

2. What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?

Maybe the amount of quality projects that you have under your belt. The amount of languages you know and how you can operate at a skillful level with many of them. Having projects with meaning or actual purpose to showcase to an employer are a few things. 

3. What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?

At this point I wouldnt say that I have any projects that are worth putting into my portfolio. That sucks to say but I honestly believe that none of the projects that I have produced are of a showing quality for lack of better terms at the moment. However I plan to take these weeks into the final to go back and better construct projects like, network, tower, and potentially site clone. Site clone will be a personal project that serves a purpose for my father.
