> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?

The problem of having to have a whole bunch of objects tied together by creating a single method that covers many objects without having to directly correlate certain objects that you may not want to. I found this term on google and it makes sense, A one to many dependency between objects. 

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

The subscribe method, the unsubscribe method, and the broadcast method which creates the tree of the observer pattern. 

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.

The one thing that ive noticed to be extremely helpful is the listener when maybe you are trying to draw listing or better yet adding to a page like gregslist it will automatically drawCars or drawHouses upon any changes that were made. Making it nice that you dont have to find where you want the draw and when to draw it because honestly that was a battle for me. Now all I have to remember is that an equal sign ques the listener after I ProxyState.on. Super cool and handy.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Things will indeed get crazy at times if you choose not to follow the methods put in place and you will easily get lost and be caught up chasing errors and debugging for quite some time. Follow the steps and continue to test along the way and verify that templates are drawing, then data is being applied without disappearing on reload, then maybe the button to add items is working properly followed by deleting items. It can be a pain if you get to far ahead of yourself with no real plan on whats next.
