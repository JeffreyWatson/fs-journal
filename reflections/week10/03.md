## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

The row is the id, name, age, description and so on. The column is what defines each of these values. 

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.

CREATE TABLE
    IF NOT EXISTS characters (
        id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT primary key COMMENT 'primary key',
        createdAt DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP COMMENT 'Time Created',
        updatedAt DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP COMMENT 'Last Update',
        name string NOT NULL,
        age string NOT NULL,
        description string NOT NULL,
    ) default charset utf8 COMMENT '';

3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

DELETE FROM is allowing you to just delete a specific item that has been created on the table and DROP TABLE is going to delete the whole table that you input. Im sure this DELETE FROM is going to be something commonly used in the workplace compared to the alternative DROP TABLE.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

This is starting to make a little more sense but the syntax of this new framework is kicking my butt and I need to quickly get this figured out before it becomes an issue that im not able to solve before next friday. I know i sound so negative but I am so nervous and I do not want to be a failure when I know im more than capable of completing this course. Syntax and order of operations is my biggest takeaway from today.
