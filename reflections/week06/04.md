## Questions

1. What is a nested route?

A route that allows for more complex user interfaces with components nested inside each other.

2. When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)

Anywhere where you need to organize routes where components are nested multiple levels deep. A good example would be say when you have a page that could consist of multiple types of that particular page. Say a crypto currency website that displays the values and origins of each coin you could list the names of all of the particular cryptos with routers that takes you to that particular cryptos information.

3. Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?

yes you can and you might use them say when you want to access maybe the account info of a particular users profile page on a social media platform. I could be wrong but I believe you could pass things such as id, or an email if that option was available.

Maintain a understandable road map of what you are doing and the processes you are taking to put yourself in a better position not to get lost in coding. I ran into some issues because I was flying through and not testing and seeing if anything was working and when I ran into problems I had to troubleshoot for quite sometime.
