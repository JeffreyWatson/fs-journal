## Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

An Enum is a unique value type that will allow you to assign symbolic names to integral values. Some use cases that we have ran into so far as students, are to create general types for events and now recipes. To be able to search by keywords that are enums and to sort by types of enums. 

2. How can you modify an Enum?

I cannot seem to find a way to explain the ways to modify an Enum from what it is that I am reading and researching. I will need some help with this question to better understand the way or ways to modify an Enum. Please and thank you. 

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

An enum could have been integrated into our capstone project which was creating a calender app for scheduling. Enum the days of the week to better be able to access them at some point of the project. I apologize for the lack of specifics as this one has me a bit confused to say the least.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Thank god im feeling better about c# today. I still feel lost at times but Im understanding more about it now than I was for the first 3 days. I should've known since this has been the whole learning process throughout the whole course but lets hope I can complete this checkpoint correctly and be in a comfortable place come next Friday.
