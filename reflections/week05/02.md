## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?

One to one, One to many, and Many to Many.

2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`

To begin this answer I would like to point out the traditional way seems neatly separated and easier on the eyes. There isn't a whole lot of nesting going on which at times can be confusing or overwhelming for a rookie looking at it for the first time. Additionally linking makes it less likely that the app will run in the max doc size of 16 mb. Its also easier to return paginated comments. I will look up paginated. 

3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?

Some challenges you could face when managing many to many relationships is deciding if you want to sacrifice read performance. For instance you will need to look at which collection in a n:m relationship and determine which collection might produce the most results or additions of the two in the relationship. if the difference of the two collections is significantly different then one way embedding. if the difference is rather close than two way embedding.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

The syntax of back end development is extremely picky and the change of how to debug is a change of pace and will need to be understood fairly well to be able to effectively debug. I ran into issues and couldn't barely figure out how to begin the debugging process.
