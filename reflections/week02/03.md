## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

console.log() should be used to see when and where something is happening as well as the value of the variable at the time that the log method is called. I believe the elements tab also counts as writing info to the console and for this particular way it can be extremely helpful when debugging HTML and CSS styling. The sources tab is also a way to debug your code and from what ive read so far seems to be fairly versatile with the ability to also edit and add to your code in real time like the elements tab. 

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

The Elements tab is the tab that will allow you to see the breakdown of HTML and CSS. This tab is useful because it allows you to edit the code you already have in place and see the changes in real time. Allowing you to precisely adjust or correct any issues with your DOM.

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?


Utilizing the sources tab to better understand how your code is behaving and having the resources laid out in front of you via the code editor and the JavaScript Debugging pane. Utilizing break points to pause your code on the line when a function runs. Thats about the extent of my knowledge on debugging and I hope to learn lots here soon.
