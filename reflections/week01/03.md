## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

For me personally I believe that offsetting my shadows and utilizing the box shadows in general can improve my rookie abilities to design. From the few experiences ive had, I can notice that either not using shadows and using them incorrectly can make the design look extremely clunky or too extra!!!!!!! Kind of like those exclamation marks.

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

I have compiled all links within the journal reading for resources as they all seem as if they will be extremely helpful down the road. Material design guidelines, fontawesome, and heroicons being the most intriguing at this point in time.

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

From the eyes of a consumer, good design can be welcoming and worth taking time to peruse an article, marketplace, or social media platform. Many sorts of things can be conveyed through design but I believe the most valuable thing that can be conveyed is feelings/emotions with color schemes and placements of pictures, ads, or other eye candy pieces of text or images.
