## Questions

1. What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?

It allows the developer to describe a relationship between two classes. One class is the derived class and the other is a base class. It allows the derived class to take the properties of the base class and inherits them.

2. How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class? 

From the base class which is the parent class, you can inherit all of the properties of that class with a child class that is constructed correctly to branch off of the main class. Yes it can inherit all members of the base class. 

3. How does accessibility affect inheritance?

It can be tricky when working with private classes and how you are able to extract the properties that the private class contains. However there are ways that you can achieve this like nesting your child class inside of the parent class to still allow the child class to inherit the properties.
