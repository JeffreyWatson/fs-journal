## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

To begin this journal is actually extremely emotional for some odd reason. Life has been a damn roller coaster since the start of this course. Many of the reasons because of the course and other reasons that are unrelated. Its been a blessing to experience this at a time in my life where I really do not believe in my self the way I always have. Ive been taught that if you really want something in this life you need to get up and just do it shout out Nike! Nobody is gonna do it for you and really all you got is yourself and everything within yourself that will help you accomplish whatever it is you put your efforts towards. In my case its been CodeWorks. Ive learned more than I could ever have expected when first coming in to this course. Its been truly life changing and eye opening to what I can do with my Knowledge and ability to learn. I appreciate each and every one of the staff members here at Codeworks for their role in helping me get this point. A ton of credit goes to Brittany for being there for me when I did not want to continue this course. She was there for me when I needed to let out my feelings. Something I never do for just anybody and without that I probably would not have showed up the upcoming week when I was not doing well. However, Im here and have no concerns with this final. Or at least none that Im willing to speak into existence. Im a little superstitious. I plan to manage my time like any other project. Attack the monster head on and avoid getting hung up on little things that have slowed me down in past checkpoints. Taking plenty of breaks and not overloading my brain with the task at hand. I have enjoyed this course for so many reasons but the biggest thing I have enjoyed has to be the relationships that I have made and the camaraderie when doing group projects throughout my time here at Codeworks.
