## Questions

1. What is a List in C#?

A list is just a collection of items that you input using the correct syntax of c#. 

2. What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?

List[index] is for sure gonna be a method that is used often because it allows you to specifically select an item at whatever position of the list that the items is stored at. Another one would be List.Add which is self explanatory, even for me. And potentially List.AddRange for when you want to combine two different collections to make one. 

3. How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use? 

List.IndexOf seems like a good option. This method would allow me to find the index of whatever value it is Im looking for.
