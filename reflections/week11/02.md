CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,

  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctorsPatients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

string sql = @"
      SELECT
        d.*,
        p.*,
        dp.id AS doctorsPatientsId

      JOIN patients p ON p.id = dp.patientId
