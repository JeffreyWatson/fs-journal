## Questions

1. What problem does using exports solve?

Scalability. Being able to utilize just the bits of code that you need to implement in certain aspects of an app that you may be creating. Efficiency comes along with that which could be another potential problem that can be "solved".

2. How does export differ from export default?

Export receives the reference to the exported variable while the export default just exports the variable with no reference of the variable.

3. What is a benefit of using the Module System?

Smaller files of self contained functionality, debugging gets easier, and I think one of the most important benefits is clean code. It allows you to organize your code better.
