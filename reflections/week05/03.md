## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?

Calender based practice for time management and allocation of that time to certain projects. Say you have a 8 hr work day 2 hrs for index.htm, 2 hrs for css, 2 hrs for js, and 2 hrs for fixing it all. Boom.

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?

2 min rul - With small tasks I can apply the 2 min rule and cut down the amount of time I waste by dragging my feet on a simple task. 
Parkinsons Law - I wont set an alotted amount of time that is too long and unneccassary. I tend to do that and always use the time that I set aside to avoid other things that need to be done. 
Prioritizing - I tend to not prioritize anything and by bedtime, important chores or tasks were not completed but irrelevant task were completed. I will determine whats absolutely necessary and what might not be. 

3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 

Every single checkpoint since i have been in school. If i could better schedule my time throughout the weekend I wouldnt always feel so stressed and rushed if I wouldve just managed my time just a little bit better.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Practice practice practice will do the trick to becoming efficient in the server side of developing. It is monotonous it seems like and can be understood rather quickly at least with the few days that we have been working on this portion of the class. I hated it on Monday and im finally starting to warm up to it.
