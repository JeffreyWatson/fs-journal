## Questions

1. What is a virtual property?

An additional model function that returns values based off of default schema fields. It is also a property that is not stored in MongoDB. Their values can be set manually or automatically with defined functionality. 

2. When might you use a virtual property? 

When you would like to tie a particular class to a parent element you could then create a virtual in the chosen model and add whateverId you want to said model class. 

3. How do you search by a virtual properties value?

log (property a + ' ' + property b) I believe this is called concatenation.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Not much of an assignment but we had time to prepare for the hackathon. Building out a pre planned day of events is a lot easier than just coming in and winging it. It was super fun to collaborate with fellow students to see what other ideas they had to best plan our attack of this project.
