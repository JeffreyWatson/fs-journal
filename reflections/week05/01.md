## Questions

1. What is the purpose of a Query String?

TO allow you to pass info to and from a website by simply adding or appending that info to the end of a URL. The info is then stored in the string and is captured by the website when it reads the URL. 

2. What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?

it starts with a ? mark followed by whatever parameters you are adding. To distinguish between two parameters you have you use the & sign and it will separate the two parameters.

3. When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?

They could be helpful for many reasons im sure but to name a few I think they can be useful when filtering certain criteria and sorting thru that criteria. And to represent a current page of a web app.
