## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

A Pseudo-Class is a special element essentially and is used to style certain elements that meet certain criteria. It is expressed using a colon after a selector. I will probably use :hover, :first-child, and :nth-child most commonly.

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

A function that helps decide which rule will be used in the instance of two rules targeting the same property and element. Once knowing the specificity of a particular group of id's, elements, or classes you can target certain items without affecting other items. Hopefully that makes sense because it did to me.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

Certain styling methods or classes not being accessed when you want and a difficulty finding where to correct the issue when running into above said issue.
