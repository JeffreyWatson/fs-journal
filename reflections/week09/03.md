## Questions

1. What is a Base64 Encoded Image?

Its the result of converting a binary image to a base64 string. These images are commonly used in web development as inlined images embedded in html css and js files. 

2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 Encoding?

I think that the main drawback of using base64 encoding is that base64 encoding will require a substantial amount of additional space compared to regular strings. Additionally CPU overhead and caching issues are drawbacks that were read through this article which Im sure is just hindering efficiency from the sound of it.

3. Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?

In the past, web browsers had heavy limits on the number of concurrent connections they could send to the server. Base64 solved that problem so now you are left with the issues discussed in the previous question. I really hope I understood that question right.
