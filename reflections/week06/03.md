## Questions

1. What are lifecycle hooks? What are lifecycle hooks used for?

Lifecycle hooks are a "window" into how the library youre using works behind the scenes. They allow you to know when your component is created, added to the DOM, updated, or destroyed. 

2. How have you utilized lifecycle hooks in your afternoon projects?

At this point, all I believe ive used them for is onMounted which allows the data ive called for to be rendered to the page. Another instance where I used it was during tomorrows assignment where in the modal we use a OnBeforeUnmount which I dont completely understand how that works and will need to dig deeper into what is actually happen or perhaps ask questions. 

3. What are mounting hooks? When might you use them?

Hooks that allow you to access your component immediately before and after the first render. They do not run during the server-side rendering. You might use it to send an http request to fetch data that the component will render.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Data can be quickly added to the page using vue and it seems as if the process of creating an application is becoming increasingly quicker than what it was for me withing the first few weeks. This is to be expected however I was not expecting to feel this confident and quick for my expectations. It feels amazing.
