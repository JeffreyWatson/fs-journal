## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 

To provide a blueprint for developers in the creation process of a webpage including several elements such as, page structure, info architecture, and functionality to name a few. Additionally its to keep the concept user friendly and clarifies the website features that will be added along the way. 

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

There are 3 levels to wireframing. Low-fidelity, mid-fidelity, and high-fidelity. Low is useful for getting an idea in mind, essentially getting the ball rolling in the development process. Mid is the most common which makes sense because the use for this level of wireframing is to emulate a more accurate representation of the page layout. More in depth requirements or ideas of components and features being clearly laid out. High fidelity is the last one which would include pixel-specific layouts, actual images, and relevant written content. This most complex level of wireframing is for, well, more complex concepts to be implemented throughout the development process. 

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

I believe that it all depends on the type of person you are. Some individuals might be more efficient in creating a project with the idea in mind. Others might need a model (wireframe) to refer to throughout the process of developing. I do however think that it is definitely worth the time to create a wireframe that can be referenced during construction of a webpage for many reasons. Can it be accomplished without one? Yes. Thats for the really artistic individuals.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Wireframing is nice to get an idea of whats to be created. For me personally it creates time to get my bearings straight. Having time to understand concepts and map them out will better help me during the construction of the project. Working in the construction industry ive learned that blueprints are a significant part of the construction of roads, subdivisions, and homes. Without them, and wireframes, construction workers and developers might find themselves running around in circles with no clear assignment or objective in mind. That could lead to some hectic and confusing projects.
