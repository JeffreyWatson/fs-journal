## Questions

1. What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?

Literally documenting what the code is, does, and potential inputs for certain areas of the code that is being documented. How to guides, add a readME on the repository, and code documentation in the source. 

2. What are some benefits of Code Documentation?

You will constantly be able to better understand what all this piece of code does down the road instead of seeing it a month later and not knowing what is doing what and why this input was used here and what not. 

3. How important is Code documentation and why?

Personally I believe code documentation is extremely important and why it is for me is simply because I am new to coding. Being able to make the code understandable after the fact will better solidify the knowledge that is being learned and how to implement it in different code for different projects at later dates. Also for a particular project say you document the code the entire time, before you know it your vscode will be telling you exactly what you need to do and when. Thats exciting for me.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

The intricacies of vue can be challenging if you allow little errors to stay while continuing to code. This is something that ive known better already and still made this mistake of trying to ignore some errors that just led to more errors when continuing our partner project. Slowing down and tackling the current task and issues will prove to be the best option ALWAYS.
