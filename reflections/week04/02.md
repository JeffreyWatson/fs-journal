## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?

Pending - Inital state, before the promise succeeds or fails.
Resolved - Completed promise
Rejected - Failed promise.

2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?

Promises in js are a way to handle async operations in node.js. It allows us to return a value from an async function like sync functions. Promises can handle async operations easily and provide better error handling than callbacks and events. 

3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?

Then is called after the promise is resolved and we can decided what to do with the resolved promise. Catch is only used for unresolved promises or better yet rejected promises. So attach the catch method after the then method. I believe this is our try and catch.
