## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

To group like data and methods that operate on that data into a single unit. 

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

Exploitation by hackers, "On public APIs in particular, adding any more surface API than is necessary to use your code expands the surface area that is available for attackers". Allowing more public accessibility can make the program also more reliable than necessary on the user when that should never be the case. 

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?

Via a privileged method. Privileged functions and methods have reference-based access to the containing functionâ€™s variables even after the containing function has returned.
