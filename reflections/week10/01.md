## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

Value type, Reference type, and Pointer type. They are different by the ways that they are stored and the ways that they can correctly be amended.a

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

A value-type is a data type if it holds a data value within its own memory space. To be honest, Im struggling to figure out what the differences are from JS but one thing I did notice was that you have to declare the variable type such as string, int, bool, char, etc.

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

From my understanding a reference type stores the address location of the actual value itself. It differs greatly from value types because value types directly store the value in its memory where a reference type just has the address of the stored value that lives in a separate memory location.

This is going to be another learning process that is already overwhelming me and sorta making me feel like Im not capable of completing this course. Im sure this feeling will pass but as of right now I do not feel comfortable and hopefully stuff starts piecing together and I start to get a better understanding of what im looking at.
