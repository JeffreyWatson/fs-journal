## Questions

1. What are props?

Props are how we pass variables and other information around between different components. Similar to arguments in JS. 

2. What are props used for?

Props are used for passing between one component to another so that the component that receives the prop can then use the values its been given. Personally speaking ive used it throughout the week for passing ids from one component to another to verify authentication of user accounts and when editing forms as well as deleting particular items from the app. 

3. Where can props be used or accessed?

Props can be used inside of your template as well as methods, computed props, and other Javascript used in your component. Additionally if structured a particular way you can use props for watchers and lifecycle hooks.
