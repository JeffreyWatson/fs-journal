## Questions

1. Why is communication on a small team important?

I will start by saying that communication on any team is important. Now I will add that having a smaller team could be reliant on communication for this reason. More to do and in most cases not such a long period of time to complete those to dos. Communication will play a huge role in a small team to avoid any confusing or alternate mindsets when it comes to the ultimate goal of creating an application that is acceptable. 

2. What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?

Reducing the time of agile meetings that are needed throughout the day. Attacking the point of each meeting and making it clear to understand the first time to avoid extended periods of time that could avoided. 

3. What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?

That paradox is the set of tradeoffs between the speed of development and the quality of the software delivered - which is sometimes referred to as the unattainable triangle. One you sacrifice speed, the other quality, and the last money. Good and cheap wont be fast, Good service fast wont be cheap, and Fast service cheap wont be good. Ill take one or two. three cant really be an option right?... right?
