# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

I dont mean to be negative but not a whole lot went well for me. I struggle a lot and need to understand a lot better than I do at this point.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

how to better use for loops. I know it doesnt seem like a lot but it was a win for me. 

- What are you struggling with?

The vocabulary of JS. Believe it or not, knowing the correct terms to use when coding matters for me. Not knowing what to name this thing or that thing that I am doing is causing some troubles but I will work through it. 

- What would you count as a victory?

Completing this checkpoint to the best of my ability. It was not an easy one and Ive tried over and over and over to get all these different functions to work however Ive done what I can and we will see what happens.
